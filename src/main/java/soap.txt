SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

SOAP is an XML-based messaging protocol that allows applications to exchange structured
information over the internet. It provides a standard way for applications to communicate
with each other, regardless of the programming language or platform they use.

WSDL (Web Services Description Language)

WSDL is an XML-based language used to describe web services and their operations, inputs,
and outputs. It provides a way for developers to understand how to interact with a web service
without having to access its source code.


UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)

UDDI is a registry standard for web services, allowing businesses to publish and discover services
over the internet. It provides a centralized directory where developers can search for and obtain
information about available web services.

XSD

A file with the XSD file extension is most likely an XML Schema file; a text-based file format that
defines validation rules for an XML file and explains the XML form.
